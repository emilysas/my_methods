#My Methods
_____________________

Having enjoyed the weekend challenge in which I had to re-write the functionality of the [inject() method](https://github.com/emilysas/inject), I decided to have a go at working my way through as many ruby methods as I could.

##Tools Used
* Ruby
* Rspec

##Future intentions

I would like to continue doing this, as not only is it really good fun but it helps me to become more familiar with the ruby methods and how they work.
